[Wiki](https://github.com/Henrisen/SharedEnderPearls/wiki "Wiki")

Shift + Right Click with an Ender Pearl to Convert it to Bound Ender Pearl that only teleports you

Use /sep to configure the plugin

If you enable canStealPearls, anyone can Shift + Left Click any Player with an Ender Pearl to bind it to that Player
If you enable disablePostTeleportFallDamage, you won't take Fall Damage after telepoting using a bound Ender Pearl
